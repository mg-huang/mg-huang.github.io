### Biography
My name is Huang Ruiming and I am an Master student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong. I studied Electronic Information Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) from 2019 to 2023, and focused on general communication, signal processing, hardware and computer knowledge. In the senior year, further study was done on embedded development and networking.

I believe that aging is a serious challenge for the society, which has a broad research significance and market. Therefore, I would like to help design IoT systems such as smart homes and wearable devices with better aging functions through technologies such as wireless sensing, acoustic applications, and artificial intelligence.
